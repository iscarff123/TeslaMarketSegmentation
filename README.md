# Tesla Market Segmentation
### Time of Project: Spring 2020
### Class Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, I used Experian Simmons 2015 National Consumer Study data to build segmentation system for simulated a Tesla, Inc. marketing campaign. Applied feature extraction and clustering methods to split market by consumer interests and preferences to identify potential customers.
